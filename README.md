# Sorting_Algorithms-DSA
SortAlgos is an interactive Java Swing application that visualizes and compares the performance of various sorting algorithms. Enter your array, and watch as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Count Sort, Radix Sort, Shell Sort, Merge Sort, Cycle Sort, and Comb Sort compete to be the fastest!

SortAlgos - Java DSA Project with J Swing GUI

Project Description:

Welcome to SortAlgos, an intuitive Java application designed to demonstrate and compare the performance of various sorting algorithms using a J Swing graphical user interface. This project is an excellent tool for understanding the mechanics and efficiency of different sorting methods.

Features:

User-Friendly Interface: Easily input your array through a clean and simple GUI.
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: There are 10 different sorting algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Heap Sort
Counting Sort
Radix Sort
Shell Sort
Merge Sort
Cycle Sort
Comb Sort

Real-Time Performance Metrics: Visualize the time taken by each algorithm to sort the array, making it easy to identify the most efficient algorithm for your data set.

Reset Functionality: Quickly reset your inputs and results to test new arrays without restarting the application.
How It Works:

Input Array: Enter the array you want to sort in the input field.

Submit: Click the "Submit" button to see the entered array and the sorted array.
Performance Comparison: The application will display the time taken by each sorting algorithm and highlight the fastest one.

Technologies Used:

Java
Swing for GUI
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
